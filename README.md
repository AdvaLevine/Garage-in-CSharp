Garage Managment System in C#

During our C# course using oop and .NET features, a friend of mine and I created a garage system,
The garage manages different clients who display their car\ motorcycle\ truck in the garage for a service,
inclding some menu features like- 
Display current vehicles lists, order according to the vehicle state in the garage, fueling the vehicle if a fuel based vehicle and charging anf electric vehicle.
The stystem keeps track on different vehicle features, every vehicle's unique adds on- like color, fuel type, number of doors etc.
During this project we've used inheritance, the word document has a diagram that shows the heirarchy.
