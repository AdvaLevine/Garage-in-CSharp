# 🚗 Garage Management System  

A **C# Garage Management System** developed using **OOP principles** and **.NET features** as part of our C# course.  

## 📌 Features  
- Manage **cars, motorcycles, and trucks** for servicing  
- Display a list of all vehicles in the garage  
- Sort vehicles by their **service status**  
- **Refuel** fuel-based vehicles  
- **Charge** electric vehicles  
- Track unique vehicle attributes such as **color, fuel type, number of doors, etc.**
  
## 🏗️ Design Patterns & Data Structures Used  
- **Bridge Pattern** – Used to separate vehicle types from their specific characteristics  
- **Factory Pattern** – Implemented to create different vehicle instances dynamically
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **C#**  
- **.NET**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.)  

## 📄 Project Structure  
The system is built with an **inheritance-based hierarchy** to efficiently manage different vehicle types.  
For a detailed overview, refer to the **hierarchy diagram** in the included Word document.
